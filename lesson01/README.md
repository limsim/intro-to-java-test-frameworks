# Lesson 1

* Create a test class
  * Postfix the name of the test class with "Test" e.g. CalculatorTest
  * Execute ```mvn test```. What do you see in the output?
* Try renaming the test class to end with something other than Test e.g. CalculatorCheck and run the test
  * Execute ```mvn test``` again. What do you see in the output now?
